## Project Description
A responsive Weather Dashboard that fetches real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API, displaying current conditions and a 5-day forecast. 

## Branch Strategy
We used a professional Git workflow:
- `main`: Production-ready code (Protected) 
- `develop`: Integration branch for merging features 
- `feature/**`: Individual branches for each team member 

## Individual Contributions
### ITBNM-2313-0061
- Repository setup, branch protection, and CI/CD pipeline configuration 
- Documented the merge conflict resolution

### ITBNM-2313-0089
- Developed weather API fetch logic and backend integration 

### ITBNM-2313-0088
- Designed the responsive UI/UX and created the README documentation 

## Merge Conflict Resolution
We encountered a conflict in the `README.md` file while merging `feature/ui-design` into `develop`. [cite_start]We resolved it by manually editing the file to include both sections and committing the result
